# PHP

Here you can find multiple PHP projects, including from simple algorithms and forms to form validation, database access and more. 

## Requirements:

- PHP 8.0
- Apache Server
- MySQL/MariaDB Database

## Use in XAMPP:

For those projects without database access, just donwload them and put the folders into the htdocs folder. Run Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel and it'll work.

For projects with database access, download the sql script specified in the project README.md (located inside the project folder) and execute in the php admin database manager.
